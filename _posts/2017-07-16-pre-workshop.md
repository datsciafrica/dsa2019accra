#### Stuff to install..

To ensure we hit the ground running, it is essential you install the prerequiste software and test it out and make sure it is working on your computer. The venue for the summer school will have some computers on which the software will have been installed but you are advised to come with your own laptop with the software installed.

##### Anaconda

Luckily all the software required has already been prepackaged in a bundle called *Anaconda*. You can download the various versions of the software for your laptop OS and architecture from the [Anaconda website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Please download the **Python 3.6 version**. Instructions on how to install are next to the download links on the Anaconda website.

#### Stuff to do..

To ensure that the software is working fine on your machine and to get you up and running, download the following [jupyter notebook](./downloads/Lesson-0 Testing  Software .ipynb) (right click and 'save as') and do the exercises in there. To access it you'll need to run a jupyter notebook ([instructions](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html#launching-notebook)).
