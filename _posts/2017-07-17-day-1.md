<h3> Summer School Day 1 </h3>

<p>The first day of the data science school will introduce the jupyter notebook and overview the use of python for analyzing data. We will introduce the machine learning technique of classification and perform lab practicals exploring these techniques as well as introduce the fundamentals of IoT.</p>
